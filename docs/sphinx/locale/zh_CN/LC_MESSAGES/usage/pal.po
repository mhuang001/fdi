"Product Access Layer allows data stored logical \"pools\" to be accessed "
"with light weight product refernces by data processers, data storage, and"
" data consumers. A data product can include a context built with "
"references of relevant data. A ``ProductStorage`` interface is provided "
"to handle saving/retrieving/querying data in registered pools."

msgid ""
"In a data processing pipeline or network of processing nodes, data "
"products are generated within a context which may include input data, "
"reference data, and auxiliary data of many kind. It is often needed to "
"have relevant context recorded with a product. However the context could "
"have a large size so including their actual data as metadata of the "
"product is often impractical."

#: ../sphinx/usage/pal.rst:18

"Once FDI data are generated they can have a reference through which they "
"can be accessed. The size of such references are typically less than a "
"few hundred bytes, like a URL. In the product context only data "
