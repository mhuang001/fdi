msgid "Data products  produced by data processing procedures are meant to be read, underatood, and used by others. Many people tend to store data with no note of meaning attached to those data. Without attached explanation, it is difficult for other people to fully understand or use correctly a collection of numbers. It could be difficult for even the data producer to recall the exact meaning of the numbers after a while. When someone receives a data 'product', besides dataets, one would expect explanation informaion associated with the product."

msgid "FDI implements a data product container scheme so that not only description and other metadata (data about data) are always attached to the \"payload\" data, but also that your data can have its context data attached as light weight references. One can organize scalar, vector, array, table types of data in the form of sequences, mappings, with nesting and referencing."

msgid "FDI is meant to be a small open-source package. Data stored in FDI ojects are easily accessible with Python API and are exported (serialized and stored by default) in cross-platform, human-readable JSON format. There are heavier formats (e..g. HDF5) and packages (e.g. iRODS) for similar goals. FDI's data model was originally inspired by  `Herschel Common Software System (v15)  products <https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/herschel/data-products-overview/>`_, taking other  requirements of scientific observation and data processing into account. The APIs are kept as compatible with HCSS (written in Java, and in Jython for scripting) as possible."
